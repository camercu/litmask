//! Internal proc-macro crate for `litmask`.
//!
//! Users add `litmask` as a dependency, never this crate directly. The
//! public `litmask` crate re-exports the macros here.
//!
//! `#[proc_macro]` attributes are required by rustc to live in the
//! crate root, so this file only carries the entry points. The input
//! grammar and expansion logic for each macro lives in its own
//! submodule:
//!
//! - [`mask!`] — AEAD-encrypt a literal at compile time.
//! - [`unmasked!`] — identity wrapper marking an opt-out literal.
//! - [`mask_format!`] — masked format-string template.
//! - [`weak_mask!`] — XOR-against-wrapper anti-`strings(1)` obfuscation.
//! - [`macro@mask_all`] — module-level attribute that rewrites every
//!   masking-eligible literal in the attributed module.

/// ```ignore
/// let token = litmask::Zeroizing::new(litmask::mask!("super-secret"));

/// ```
///
/// This is memory-remanence hygiene (shrinks the window a dropped secret
/// is recoverable from a core dump, swap, or hibernation image); it does
/// not defend against a live debugger or prevent re-derivation, and any
/// `.clone()` / `format!` / print copy escapes the wrapper. `mask!(c"…")`
/// (`CString`) is not wrappable this way — decrypt as `mask!("…")`, wrap
/// the `String`, and build a transient `CString` at the FFI boundary.
///

///
/// - Non-literal input (including macro invocations such as
///   `include_str!`, `concat!`, `env!`, or user-defined macros):

///   or are dead-code-eliminated in release builds.
/// - Qualified macro paths (`std::format!`, `core::dbg!`, etc.) are
///   recognized by matching the last path segment.
///
/// # Return-type side effects
///

/// |---|---|

/// rewrite and keep the stdlib return type.
///
/// Literals are left untouched (with a per-occurrence warning) when:
///
/// - The literal appears in a pattern position (`match`, `if let`,
///   `while let`) — patterns cannot accept macro invocations.
/// - The literal initializes a `const` or `static` — `mask!()`
///   returns a runtime value and cannot be evaluated at compile
///   time.
/// - The literal is an argument to `mask!` / `mask_format!` /
///   `unmasked!` / `weak_mask!` — the user has already chosen
///   explicitly.
/// - The literal is an argument to a recognized diagnostic-only
///   macro (`dbg!`, `stringify!`, `compile_error!`, `cfg!`, `file!`,
///   `line!`, `column!`, `module_path!`, or any of the assert family
///   in no-message form) — these serve compile-time or developer
///   purposes and never embed the literal as user-facing data.
/// - The literal is an argument to a user-defined or otherwise
