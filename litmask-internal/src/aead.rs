//! AEAD encrypt/decrypt dispatch across compile-time-selected ciphers.
//!
//! # Cipher selection
//!
//! [`CURRENT_CIPHER`] names the single cipher this build encrypts and
//! blob-decrypts with. When both cipher features are active (e.g.
//! `cargo build -p litmask --features aes-gcm` keeps the default
//! `chacha20-poly1305` alive under Cargo feature unification, or
//! `cargo test --all-features`), `aes-gcm` wins: passing it is an
//! explicit opt-in to AES-256-GCM. For a strict single-cipher build
//! with no `chacha20poly1305` crate in the dep tree, use
//! `--no-default-features --features std,aes-gcm`.
//!
//! There is no cipher-id byte on the wire (§1.7.3): each build seals and
//! opens with its one [`CURRENT_CIPHER`], so the `cipher_id` the dispatch
//! takes is always that cipher and the other arm is unreachable.

// Feature → import mapping for the shared AEAD trait surface:
//
//  chacha only (default)    → traits from chacha20poly1305, ChaCha20Poly1305 cipher
//  aes-gcm only             → traits from aes-gcm,          Aes256Gcm cipher
//  both features active     → traits from chacha20poly1305, both ciphers
//
// The AEAD traits are re-exported identically by both backend crates;
// importing from either path is sufficient. Keys, nonces, and tags cross
// the trait boundary as `&hybrid_array::Array`, which fixed-size `&[u8; N]`
// converts into infallibly via `From` (`aead` 0.6 dropped the old
// `generic_array::GenericArray`; its `Array::from_slice` is deprecated, so
// the `.into()` conversions below are load-bearing, not stylistic).
// `AeadInOut` supplies the in-place `decrypt_inout_detached` that replaced
// `AeadInPlace::decrypt_in_place_detached`.
